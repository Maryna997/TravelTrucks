# TravelTrucks

## Project Description

**TravelTrucks** is an online platform for choosing and renting camper vans. It allows users to quickly find the right vehicle by applying filters such as type, location, or available features. The aim is to offer a simple and efficient way to search for campers that match every user's needs.

## Main Features

- **Parameter-Based Filtering**: Find a vehicle by narrowing results with type, location, and available features.
- **Equipment Filtering**: Search specifically for campers equipped with items like a kitchen, shower, gas stove, radio, manual or automatic transmission, microwave, water system, refrigerator/freezer, TV, or air conditioning.
- **Favorites List**: Save selected vehicles to favorites for quick and easy access later.
- **Detailed View**: The _Show More_ button reveals complete information, including photos and customer reviews.
- **Booking Form**: A form to provide personal details when reserving a vehicle. At present, the data is not submitted to a manager, but this functionality could be added for commercial purposes in the future.
